# Decoding-of-imagined-speech-in-EEG-by-Deep-Learning
This repository has an open database of imagined speech in EEG. This database contains all the phonemes in Spanish as well as words from different semantic fields such as instruments, body parts, animals, etc. To date it is the most extensive database in Spanish. Moreover, the repository contains the Deep Learning models used for the decoding of the imagined speech, as well as the EEG signal preprocessing code.
