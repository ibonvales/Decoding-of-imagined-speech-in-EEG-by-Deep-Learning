# Decoding-of-imagined-speech-in-EEG-by-Deep-Learning
This repository has all the codes used in the decoding of imagined speech in EEG. The "Datos" folders contein all the analysis done in the model training (Also a Drive with the Accuracy and F1 Score of all condition and all frequency bands. Moreover, the Stadistical Analysis folder contains all the statisitical analysis done in the three types of objectives: Production decoding (Rest vs Imagined vs Real), Vowel Decoding (A,E,I,O,U) and Semantic Decoding (Clothes, Animals, Musical Instruments, Food, Kitchen elements and Body Parts). The EEG Prepro folder has the used code with MNE library to obtain the Morlet Wavelets of all vowels, semantic categories and type of production, across all brain oscillations. 

As of June 13, 2024, the preregistration for the experiment, which will be conducted next month along with its subsequent data analysis and preprocessing, has been uploaded.
